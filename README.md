# Auth0 Implicit Utils

Authenticate means figure out who the user is given 
the current state of the user agent (i.e the browser or device).
Authenticating results in one of three possibilities:

- the user is known and has a valid session
- the user is anonymous, but the previous user is known due to an expired or invalid browser session
- the user is anonymous
